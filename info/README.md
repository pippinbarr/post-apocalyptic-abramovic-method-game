## Description
*The sky is grey! The birds all flew! There’s no more trees for complaining to! The table’s turned! The rice is gone! The world is over, but the Method is strong!*

_Post-Apocalyptic Abramovic Method Game_ was made in [Unity](http://unity3d.com) (using [First Person Drifter](http://torahhorse.com/first-person-drifter-controller-for-unity3d) by [Ben Esposito](http://torahhorse.com/) with a couple of small edits) and [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/). It is a spiritual sequel to the earlier _[Abramovic Method Games](http://www.pippinbarr.com/abramovic-method-games/info)_, but is not an official collaboration with Marina Abramovic or MAI.
